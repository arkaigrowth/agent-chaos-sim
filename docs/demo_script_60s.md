# 60-Second Demo Voiceover Script

[0:00-0:05] **INTRO**
"Your agent works perfectly—until production hits it with a 429 rate limit at 3am."

[0:05-0:15] **PROBLEM**
"Most agents break on first contact with reality. Network timeouts, server errors, malformed responses—they're not edge cases, they're Tuesday. But testing these failures manually? That's chaos without control."

[0:15-0:25] **SOLUTION**
"Chaos Lab lets you break your agent systematically. Pick a scenario—web scraping, RAG, or JSON parsing. Run baseline to see normal behavior. Then flip the chaos switch: inject 500 errors, rate limits, corrupt data."

[0:25-0:40] **DEMO**
"Watch this: baseline run succeeds in 1.2 seconds. Now with chaos—500 error on step two. The agent retries, backs off, recovers. Total time: 3.8 seconds, but it still completes. That's a resilience score of 87. See the trace? Every retry, every recovery, logged and measurable."

[0:40-0:50] **RESULTS**
"Side-by-side comparison shows exactly where your agent struggles. Download the trace, tweak your retry logic, test again. Deterministic seeds mean you can replay exact failure patterns."

[0:50-0:60] **CTA**
"Ready to crash-test your agent? Hit remix, swap in your endpoints, and find out if your AI can take a punch. Chaos Lab—because production is coming whether you're ready or not."

*Timing notes: Sync demos to actual UI interactions. Show real traces, real scores. Keep energy high but tone confident, not frantic.*
