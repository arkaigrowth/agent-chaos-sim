examples:
  cards:
    - "API Meltdown|Simulate 500s + 429s. Watch your agent retry, backoff, or crash. Know before prod knows."
    - "Garbage JSON|Corrupt payloads mid-flight. Test if your parser panics or recovers gracefully."
    - "RAG Injection|Add a benign prompt injection. See if your agent follows the trap or stays on task."
    - "Latency Spike|Inject 2â€“10s delays randomly. Does your agent timeout or adapt with async fallbacks?"
    - "Tool Vanishes|Kill a dependency mid-run. Test if your agent finds alternatives or fails hard."
    - "Context Bomb|Overflow token limits on purpose. Watch truncation handling or memory management kick in."
